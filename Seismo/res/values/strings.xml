<string name="help"><b>Seismo</b> is an application that allows you to measure acceleration using your Android device. In the main screen, the vertical line being drawn on screen represents the acceleration of your device along a given spatial dimension relative to the device. The axis along the left side of the screen shows the time in seconds since measurement was started. The axis along the top of the screen shows the acceleration of the device along the given spatial dimension, in units of standard Earth gravity (9.8 m/s^2).\n\nThe following options are available in the Seismo menu:\n<b>Pause/Resume</b>: Pauses or unpauses measurement of acceleration. The default is unpaused.\n<b>Unfilter/Filter</b>: Whether or not to remove constant forces like Earth\'s gravity from measurement. The default is filtered mode.\n<b>Axis</b>: Choose the spatial axis of acceleration to display. Relative to the device\'s screen, the x-axis is parallel to the short edges of the screen, the y-axis is parallel to the long edges of the screen, and the z-axis goes directly through the screen. The default axis of measurement is the z-axis.\n<b>Storage</b>: Save or export numeric measurements, in m/s^2, of the last 60 seconds of acceleration taken at 40 hz. Measurements are saved to your device\'s internal memory and can then be exported as a CSV attachment to an e-mail.\n<b>Help</b>: This document.</string>
