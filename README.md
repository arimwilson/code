Ari Wilson's code, including a variety of projects:

[KeeStand](http://keestand.appspot.com/) is a locally-secured cloud password storage web application, designed so that you can securely store and access the many passwords you need to run your daily Internet life in one place.

[Interesaint](http://interesaint.appspot.com/) is a web-based RSS/Atom feed aggregator designed for high volume feeds. It learns and surfaces the items of most interest to you.

[Scrabblish](http://scrabblish.appspot.com/) is a Scrabble solver. It is also available in command-line form [here](https://github.com/evilrobot69/code/blob/master/Scrabble/main.go).

[Seismo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ariwilson.seismo) is an Android application that measures the strength of vibration, shaking, and movement around you, much like a real [seismograph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer). [Seismo Wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ariwilson.seismowallpaper) is a live wallpaper adaptation of Seismo.

[BlockFort](http://blockfort3d.appspot.com/) is a web-based game similar to Minecraft but with less gameplay and more world-building :). Saves are backed up to the cloud.
